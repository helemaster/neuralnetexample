# Handwriting Neural Network - An Exercise in Learning Neural Networks

This project creates a simple neural network to parse handwritten number samples and determine the number they represent.

It is a Jupyter notebook with two depedent directories: **data** and **media**. Ensure they are in the root directory with the Jupyter notebook file before running. 

A PDF version is also provided that shows the outputs of all operations.
